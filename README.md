# Mood Palette

## Problem Statement

Oftentimes in people’s busy days, many do not have time to self-reflect and understand their emotional state. They might also face difficulty in communicating emotions to others or expressing their emotions through different mediums. Thus this app allows users to input 4 simple journal entries to quickly but effectively track their mood and emotions!

Many existing apps are focused solely on either tracking habits or mood, however we have created a site that combines the features of both a habit and mood tracker. According to the user’s journal entry for that day, the app also outputs a song that best matches their mood. 

This app encompasses multiple features for users to quickly reflect on their emotions through a daily thoughts journal, mood colors, and energy tracker. This can help increase emotional intelligence and awareness. Additionally, using these inputted trackers, the site outputs a daily song that best reflects their mood. A section of the app will also store all of the users past journals for them to study their emotions over time. 


## Project Objectives 
- Create a monthly calendar to keep track of the colors chosen by the user on each day.
- Allow users to create goals and record their progress over time using a habit/goal tracker.
- Devise a point system for engaging with the app every day (the points can be used to purchase outfits for their Moo Pal, the mood palette companion).
- Given a user’s textual description about their day, use Python’s NLTK library to perform sentiment analysis and convert the text to a numerical value.
- Send daily reminders to input a color of the day, their vibe, and a textual description to quickly note down the highlights of their day.
- Use the numerical values extracted from the textual description, color, and energy/vibe checker in combination with the Spotify API to return a song that will try to reflect their mood.
- Create a monthly playlist that contains all the songs that were returned to the user throughout the month.
